Hello World!
I'm here to get started using the Github repository. 
The plan is to use Github as a portfolio to make my projects 
available to the public.

Notes:
1. Flatten a 2d array into a 1d array.
2. CRUD database using MVC Entity Framework.
3. Work with RestAPI, or that database for website gig for Jon.
